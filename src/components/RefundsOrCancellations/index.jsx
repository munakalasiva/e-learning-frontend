      <h2>2. Refund Policy</h2>
      <p>

      <ul>
        <li>The product/service is faulty or damaged upon receipt.</li>

        <li>The service was not delivered within the agreed-upon timeline due to reasons within our control.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Non-Refundable Services:</strong> Certain services, once initiated or delivered, are non-refundable. These include but are not limited to:

      <ul>
        <li>Custom services that have already started or are completed.</li>

      <h2>3. Refund Request Process</h2>
      <p>

      <h2>4. Late or Missing Refunds</h2>
      <p>
        If you haven’t received a refund within the specified period, please first check your bank account again.
        Then, contact your credit card company, as it may take some time before your refund is officially posted.
